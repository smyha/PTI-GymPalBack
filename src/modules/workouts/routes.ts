/**
 * Workout Routes Module
 * 
 * This module defines all workout-related routes:
 * - Workout plan CRUD operations
 * - Exercise management within workouts
 * - Workout session management (start, complete, track)
 * - Workout history and statistics
 * 
 * All routes require authentication and use schema validation.
